# KanjiFlashcards

## Progress Report/Changelog
4/11/23

Implemented:
 - Drag and drop functionality: can drag a flashcard and drop it anywhere on the ScatterBoard. Attempting to drop the card off screen sets the
   flashcard at the border of the window.

Needs to be Implemented next: refreshing the ScatterBoard with FlashCards
 - A button is planned to be used, but the button must be able to control the state of the ScatterBoard. Currently, there is an object "values" that keeps
   track of the values of the flashcards currently in play, so updating "values" will not affect the state of the ScatterBoard.
